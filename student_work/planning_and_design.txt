Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:
Prison escape room
Endless levels

Game Rules:
You move one tile at a time, so does the guard and you try not to get caught.
If the guard touches you, you lose. If you make it to the exit square, you win

Major Game Elements:
Obstacles/walls you have to go around.
Police officer chasing after you.
Exit square if you reach, you win.
Randomized walls and replayability.
Difficulty levels (More police officers, more distance)
Tracker to keep score of how many levels you complete

Gameplay Process:
WASD to move
Make it to the exit square to escape prison
Enemies move one square at a time
Starting grid is 4x4 and it gains size every other run
